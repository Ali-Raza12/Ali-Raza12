I'm Ali Raza, a passionate Software Engineer with a keen interest in Python Development and Computer Vision. Welcome to my GitHub profile!


## üíº Professional Experience

As an AI Engineer at Thingtrax Ltd, responsible for developing applications by implementing and optimizing Computer Vision models to create cutting-edge solutions for visual recognition tasks.

- Collaborated with stakeholders to understand project objectives and prepared datasets to meet object tracking requirements. Acquired expertise through hands-on experience with Jetson Inference Utility for edge object detection. Conducted training and evaluation processes on AWS EC2, successfully deployed custom-trained models on Jetson edge devices.

- Worked extensively on training and deploying YOLO and SSD models, optimized inferencing time with the help of OpenVINO and TensorRT. Additionally, integrated the optimized models with OpenCV DNN Module for efficient and accurate object detection and recognition tasks.

- Gained experience in utilizing Azure's Optical Character Recognition Services and training the model to achieve reliable Form recognition results. This involved leveraging the capabilities of the Azure OCR Service to train the model to accurately recognize and extract data from various forms, such as invoices, receipts, and surveys.

- Designed and developed a Flask Application for streaming RTSP link inside a web browser, eliminating the need for an external video player and enabling real-time video feed viewing for users.
